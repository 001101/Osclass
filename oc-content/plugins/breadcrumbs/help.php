<h2><?php _e("How does Banner Management work?");?></h2>
<?php _e("In Banner Management we have two entities, campaigns and banners. Think of a banner as an image, a flash movie or a text link, or what ever you want. Think of a campaign as a place holder for one or several banners, for example a list of images on your sidebar. Banners are 'inside' campaigns. This scheme allows you to manage your banners without having to change the whole HTML code each time, let's say you have a '5 images(banners) list' (campaign). Then, you may want to change one of the images(banner) for a Flash movie, you simply edit that banner to include a Flash movie, and that's all. If for example you want to reduce the list from 5 to 4 banners, you only have to modify your campaign.");?>
